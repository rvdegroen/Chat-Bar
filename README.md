# Live demo

This is the link to the live demo of this application: https://basic-chatroom-production-6d2c.up.railway.app/

# Installation

To install the application locally you can follow these next steps:

1. Clone the repository with `git clone [LINK]`
2. Go into the folder that you cloned and open the project in your code editor
3. Install the dependencies with `npm i` in the terminal

# Process

In this section I'll be talking more about the process. This is more relevant for teachers who will be grading this project.

## Ideas

In week 1 I came up with 3 ideas as listed below:

1. Create an application in which users can make chat rooms for game-related content. In the chat, users can show different covers of games and even browse through a library of pictures related to the game. The chat room will be named after the game that is shown in the chatroom, so that people can join a room depending on their interests.

2. Create a chatroom in which people can make their own chat rooms. People who create the chat room will be hosts and will have special functionalities unlike other users, such as being able to change the background of the room or kick someone out of the room. Additionally, the host can choose a radio station to which people will listen. Other users will only be able to adjust the volume of the radio, but not the channel.

3. People can create a chatroom, and other users can join a certain chatroom based on the code that the chatroom has. If you don't have the code, you're not able to join the chatroom as a user.

4. Create an application in which users can guess in chat who the speaker is of a quote from the show "The Office (US)". Once the correct name has been found, the correct user will be given coins, which they can use to customize their chat (such as chat bubble color, text color, and choosing their own background color).

5. Create a chatroom with a bar theme. There's a jukebox: each user can choose their own radio channel to listen to. They also play a small bartender game and mix drinks that gets a certain score. The score depends on certain recipes.

## Chosen Idea

For my final assingment, I went with my 5th idea, simply, because I love the vibe of certain bars and playing a little bar game, really fits the theme. It makes it more interactive and a bit more fun. I also have an idea of what kind of radio channels I want to have in my chatrooms and those are more smooth jazz or bossa nova jazz related, because I personally like to hear those kind of tracks in a bar.

## Inspiration

I looked up for inspiration in old screenshots I saved myself from old chats I have visited in the past. These screenshots are from around 2014 and the websites don't exist anymore (unfortunately), but they still hold a special place in my heart, as I have spent a lot of my time in those chatrooms.

## Prototype

In week 1, I made my first prototype with the inspiration I have found. I made this prototype in Figma. I find it easier to make myself a complete design before starting coding, so I won't have to think about the design as much during the coding process. If I wouldn't do this, I usually end up feeling frustrated while coding, so that's why I decided to do this.
